## Development

### Quickstart

*(There's a [docker](#using-docker) section down there!)*

Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/),
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos) and
[MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

This project runs on Java 8. If you're on OSX or Linux, we recommend using
[jenv](https://github.com/jenv/jenv/blob/master/README.md) to manage your java environment.

You can check your setup by running:

    $ lein version
    Leiningen 2.9.6 on Java 16.0.1 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM

Your exact version numbers below may vary, but we require Java 1.8+.

Populate the database and create indexes using:

    $ lein fetch [--no-card-images]
    1648 cards imported

    $ lein create-indexes
    Indexes successfully created.

You can optionally pass `--no-card-images` if you don't want to download images from
[NetrunnerDB](https://netrunnerdb.com/), as this takes a while. See `lein fetch help`
for further options.

To install frontend dependencies, run:

    $ npm ci
    added 124 packages, and audited 125 packages in 2s

To compile CSS:

    $ npm run css:build
    compiled resources/public/css/netrunner.css

Optionally you can say `npm run watch:css` to watch for changes and automatically
recompile.

Compile ClojureScript frontend:

    $ npm run cljs:build
    [:app] Compiling ...
    [:app] Build completed. (238 files, 0 compiled, 0 warnings, 22.18s)

Finally, launch the webserver and the Clojure REPL:

    $ lein repl
    dev.user=>

and open [http://localhost:1042/](http://localhost:1042/).

### Using Docker

You'll need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). After that, just run `$ docker-compose up --build` in the project directory (or do the GUI-equivalent of this). If this fails because it "couldn't fetch dependencies", try again, it was just a networking error.

It can take a while. You'll see lots of messages, so just wait until you see something like `netrunner-server-1 | nREPL server started on port 44867`. After that, you can visit [http://localhost:1042/](http://localhost:1042/) and the server should be running.

While coding clojure it's important to have a REPL connection going. The server's REPL is configured to always run on port `44867`, so you can connect using `$ lein repl :connect nrepl://localhost:44867` (or the program of your preference, like your code editor).

Now, let's populate the database and create indexes. First, let's open a terminal inside the server container: `$ docker exec -it netrunner-server-1 /bin/bash`. Now, inside this new therminal, we'll run these two commands: *The `--no-card-images` is optional, and removing it causes the card images to be downloaded, which can be slower.*

```
 $ lein fetch --no-card-images
    1648 cards imported

 $ lein create-indexes
    Indexes successfully created.
```

After this, just restart the server by running `(restart)` in the REPL.

To do testing, you run them inside the container: `$ docker exec -it netrunner-server-1 /bin/bash` and then `$ lein test`.
### Tests

To run all tests:

    $ lein test
    Ran 2640 tests containing 44704 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.

To run a single test file:

    $ lein test game.cards.agendas-test
    Ran 216 tests containing 3536 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.

Or a single test:

    $ lein test :only game.cards.agendas-test/fifteen-minutes
    Ran 1 tests containing 29 assertions.
    0 failures, 0 errors.
