these are all implemented with tests, unless otherwise noted.
Leave a gap unless numbers are consecutive. This will make it easy to spot what's missing.

Features:
  Done:
    traces (not complete yet though - there are trace interrupts and other things to implement)
    Hidden Resources (some functions may leak info - figure these out later, and avoid using :title card if it can be helped)
    Regions can only be installed if you can afford to rez them, and must immediately be
      rezzed on install (maybe some issues will arise with this in the future, idk)
  Todo:
    forgo actions
    (x card) tokens

Card Updates:
  TODO:
    Write test for weapons depot once I implement a black ops agenda
    Write tests for stealth cards once the noisy cards are done (owl, cloak, invisibility,
      sunburst cranial interface, Vewy Vewy Quiet)
    Write tests for noisy cards (bulldozer, jackhammer, hammer, fubar, Pile Driver,
    	  	    	  	Ramming Piston, Wrecking Ball)
    Write trivial test templates for program trashing
    
Keys:
  + test done
  ^ no test (for some reason)
  ? not implemented (deliberately, for some reason)
