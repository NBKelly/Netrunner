  how real workloads affect the system's performance.

  On my machine, this takes about 3 minutes and consumes around 600 MB of disk
  space.

  The users are named \"<username-prefix><INDEX>\", e.g. \"sample0\",
  \"sample1\", ... and their passwords are \"password\".

  The created documents are all tied to users, i.e. as long as you use
  different username prefixes, you can run this function multiple times if
  needed.

  The created users include two extreme cases. \"sample0\" has no decks, no
  games and no messages, while \"sample1\" has approx. a thousand times the
  amount of decks, games and messages as the median."
